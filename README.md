# **MIE562 - Scheduling**

This Master's course covers various methods and techniques to solve scheduling problems.  A particular focus is placed on solving NP-complete problems such as the Job Shop Problem (JSP) using specific techniques such as:

* **Exact Techniques**
    * Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP)
    * Constraint Programming
    * Heuristic Methods such as Dispatch Rules:
        * Shortest Processing Time (SPT) first
        * weighted Shortest Processing TIme (WSPT) first
        * Earliest Due Date (EDD) first

Throughout the course, several techniques were implemented in assignments and projects.

## **Coding Assignment 1 - Implement Dispatch Rules Algorithm for Job Shop Problem (JSP)**

In this project, I implemented the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) first dispatch rule in an algorithm to solve any JSP instance.  Further details are found in the folder.

**See folder**: *assignment1_dispatch_rules*

## **Coding Assignment 2 - Mixed Integer Programming Model using Gurobi (TBC)**

**See folder**: *assignment2_mip_model*

## **Project - Sea-Container Scheduling at Sea-port**

This group project applied two modeling methods (MIP) and Constraint Programming to find optimal scheduling solutions to various instances (scenarios) of sea-containers arriving from an container ship.  The problem is a simplification of a real life problem for containers belonging to Canadian Tire.
